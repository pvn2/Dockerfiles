Monolithic Architechture vs Micro Services Architechture
Monolithic Architechture:
Entire application will be built and deployed as single entity(Package) in monolithic.
All below modules as same code base will build and deploy as a single entity
Generate single .war/.ear (flipkart.war/flipkart.war)
Entire code base should be same language
Example:
  Flipkar (Lot of modules)
     Login
     Registration
     Products
     addCart
     Payment
     Order
Advantages:
Simple to develop and simple to deploy also
Easy to debug and trace the error
Simple test

Drawbacks:
Difficult to understand modify
Tighly coupled
Any changes in one module we have to deploye whole application

Micro Services Architecture:
Application will be developed as multiple lossely coupled services(Projects)
Each module as one service (i.e micro service)
Entire application break into small application and matained independently
Each service we can develop diff language if required
Each module will generate seaprate package

drawback
Each module should communcate other module it is not going to be local call need to make network call(i.e api call) api has to invoke other service.



All feature are same code base and this will generate some package
Package contains every things

Select ElasticIP -->Actions--> Disassociate Elastic IP Address
Micro Services Architechture : Application will be developed as multiple lossely coupled services(Projects).

This microservices can be developed,deployed, maintained independently
We can develope each module different programatic language
Each module will generate separate package
One Moduel(Microsevice) is communicate to other module
Microservices very well to run under containers
ELK/EFK
Elastic Search & Log Stash Kibana
Elastic Search File Beate.Kibana
Splunk
Each microsevice will be build and deploye independently
