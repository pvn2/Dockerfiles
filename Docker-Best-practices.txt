Best Practices to Follow While Creating Docker Image & Files
------------------------------------------------------------
1.Use "Alpine" base image where ever its possible
  Alpine: 
  A minimal Docker image based on Alpine Linux with a complete package index and only 5MB in size!
  Light weight linux library
  its does not required much CPU/Memory resources
2.Don't install have un-necassary packages(software) & con't copy un-necassary files
3.Don't run container process as root user start container process(Application) as non-root user
4.Try to reduce the number of layers of image as much possible because if is more layers it will impact the application performance
  
  Example:
  RUN yum install git -y
  RUN yum install wget -y
  
  if we add above 2 entries in dockerfile and run it will generate 2 layers insted of 2 layers we can merge in single command
  RUN yum install get -y && yum install wget -y
  
  merge multiple related RUN instrcutions into single instruction so that it will create only one layer
5.Always recommanded way to use CMD and ENTRYPOINT as shell form
6.If we extract the any tar/zip file we need to delete otherwise it will increase the size un-necessary
7.Try to scan the image for vulnerabilities
  Note: 
  means un-necessary packages/software it will scan
  In ECR we have image "scan" and it will provide the report as well
  Other we have third party tools like (Anchor,ciair) 
7.Try to use "Multi-stage" dockerfile to reduce the size of finale image
